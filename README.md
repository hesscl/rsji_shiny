# RSJI Community Survey RShiny

## Aims

This was a proof of concept I created for the Seattle Office for Civil Rights' Community Survey offered in 2016. The idea behind this visualization was to give citizens a way to interface with the data collected since the survey covered many topical issues like housing affordability.
